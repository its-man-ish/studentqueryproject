## Spreadsheet 1.2.0

New Features:

* Introduced the [**Cell Referencing** feature](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/spreadsheets.html#cell-referencing) that allows referencing Spreadsheets data directly from the editor content.
* Introduced first-class support for [pasting tabular data from Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/spreadsheets.html#pasting-from-microsoft-excel-and-google-sheets) with automatic conversion.
* Introduced integration with the [Color Button](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/colorbutton) plugin that allows [changing text and background color of selected cells](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/spreadsheets.html#advanced-styles-support).
* Introduced integration with the [Font](https://ckeditor.com/cke4/addon/font) plugin that allows [changing font family and font size of selected cells](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/spreadsheets.html#advanced-styles-support).
* Introduced support for merged cells via `colspan` and `rowspan` attributes when a [regular HTML table is converted to a Spreadsheet widget](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/features/spreadsheets.html#converting-existing-tables).

Fixed Issues:

* Fixed: Converting a regular HTML table with `colspan` or `rowspan` attributes fails, freezing the browser window.
* Fixed: Frontend adapter fails without the `CKEDITOR` namespace.

API Changes:

* Introduced the [`config.spreadsheet_enableAutoConversion` configuration option](https://ckeditor.com/docs/ckeditor4/latest/guide/dev_spreadsheets.html#automatically-convert-existing-tables) that allows for automatic conversion of regular HTML tables to Spreadsheet widgets inside the editor content.
